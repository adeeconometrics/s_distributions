Edit P-distributions
1. check special functions
2. check efficient use of numpy math functions
3. check functions that may use built-in math operations
4. exception handling: change to f-strings
5. change summary and add keys function
6. check return types and mgf functions

Reminders

Efforts on maintaining class invariance
-  only do type checking when necessary assumptions need be satisfied e.g. in `df` types are required to be `int`
-  do value checking for prescribe domains of probability distributions
- find out if math.exp is more flexible than np.exp in terms of its limitationss
